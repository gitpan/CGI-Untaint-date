NAME
    CGI::Untaint::date - validate a date

SYNOPSIS
      use CGI::Untaint;
      my $handler = CGI::Untaint->new($q->Vars);

      my $date = $handler->extract(-as_date => 'date');

DESCRIPTION
  is_valid
    This Input Handler verifies that it is dealing with a reasonable date.
    Reasonably means anything that Date::Manip thinks is sensible, so you
    could use any of (for example): "December 12, 2001" "12th December,
    2001" "2001-12-12" "next Tuesday" "third Wednesday in March"

    See Date::Manip for much more information on what date formats are
    acceptable.

    The resulting date will be a Date::Simple object. Date::Simple for more
    information on this.

  date_format
    By default ambiguous dates of the format 08/09/2001 will be treated as
    UK style (i.e. 8th September rather than 9th August)

    If you want to change this, subclass it and override date_format()

WARNING
    Date::Manip does not play nicely with taint mode. In order to work
    around this we locally clobber Date::Manip's 'timezone' code. As we're
    only interested in dates rather than times, this shouldn't be much of an
    issue. If it is, then please let me know!
